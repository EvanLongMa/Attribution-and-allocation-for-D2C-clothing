# Attribution and allocation for D2C clothing toy project
Our new direct to consumer (D2C) clothing business has been running experiments to understand the best advertising channels for our product. To do this, we’ve collected a week of data from our website traffic monitoring platform to observe how spend relates to customer conversion (conversion = customer bought the product). For our paid advertising channels we’re worried about market saturation: is spending more money on marketing valuable or do we start to see diminishing returns? To test this, we ran identical ad campaigns on three different (identical) population samples that only differed by total level of spend: tier 1 ($5,000), tier 2 ($10,000), and tier 3 ($15,000). We’re interested in understanding our marketing effectiveness by channel and developing a spending allocation plan for next week’s advertising budget.
